        VT-Gens: about 4 Months, from trainee, to mod. ended because i retired,
        due to the manager changing to a rather corrupt one, and the owner not
        caring about anything anymore.

        Solarity: Only one month or less, being only a trainee. ended because of
        the co-owner unfortunately being rather weird.

        Fracture: Yet another (still running) attempt of making a server. This

        SDGens / Novalith: Two servers, by the same owners. Joined because of
        lost hope in Fracture, and in hope of actually making a successful
        server. While being basically the same, novalith is still very much in
        the making, while SDGens has more hope, and is actively being worked on.
        My roles currently are: Director on SDGens, and Manager on Novalith
